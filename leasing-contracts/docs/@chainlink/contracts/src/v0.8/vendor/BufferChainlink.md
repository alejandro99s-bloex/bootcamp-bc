# BufferChainlink







*A library for working with mutable byte buffers in Solidity. Byte buffers are mutable and expandable, and provide a variety of primitives for writing to them. At any time you can fetch a bytes object containing the current contents of the buffer. The bytes object should not be stored between operations, as it may change due to resizing of the buffer.*
